# Forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.

We elaborated this final project, only with JavaScript we covered all the topics learned in the course "The complete JavaScript".

The deployment was done in Netlify and [here](https://forkify-luismgil.netlify.app/). is the link so you can check it out

It is an application to search, add and save your favorite recipes, you can modify your recipes depending on the people you invite to experience this beautiful experience, you can filter keywords in the search engine and send all the recipes that contain that key.

I hope you like it
